# GifTastic

A dynamic webpage that populates with specified animal search. 

### How does it work?
- When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

- When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

- The user is able to input an animal name in form
